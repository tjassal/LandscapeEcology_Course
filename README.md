Documents and links needed for my Landscape Ecology course at Kent State University (GEOG 41195|51195|71195). 
Instructor: Dr. Tim Assal | Assistant Professor | KSU Dept. of Geography Contact: tassal@kent.edu

Note: This repo largely functions as a link where I can post data for the course and not a true repo.
